# Particle-Motion-using-Python
This script creates a particle simulation using the Turtle graphics module in Python. It generates multiple particles that move randomly within the screen boundaries and reappear from the opposite side when they move out of the screen. The particles also toggle their visibility randomly to create a blinking effect.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Turtle module (included with standard Python distribution)
Features
Particle Creation:
Creates a specified number of particles.
Particles are randomly sized, positioned, and move with slight random changes in direction.
Movement:
Particles move in random directions.
When a particle moves out of the screen boundary, it reappears from the opposite side.
Visibility Toggle:
Particles randomly toggle their visibility to create a blinking effect.
